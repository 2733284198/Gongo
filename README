Gongo - a Go player written in Go
Author: Brian Slesinsky
Date: November 30, 2009

This is a simple computer program that plays Go, but not very well. I
wrote it to learn the Go programming language. It's mostly of interest
as a curiosity, a starting point for people who might want to write
other Go robots in Go, and as a example of a reasonably well-commented
program written in the Go language.

The algorithm is the same (I think!) as the Java reference bot by Don Dailey,
which is described here:

You can get the Java reference bot here:

See INSTALL for installation.
