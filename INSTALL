Installation instructions for Gongo:

1) Install a Go language compiler. I have only tried it with gc, but plan
to try gccgo soon.

Instructions: http://golang.org/doc/install.html

2) Run tests

cd gongo
gotest

3) Build the binary:

make main

4) Install GoGui

The "main" program speaks a minimal version of the Go Text Protocol (GTP),
which is a standard for Go-playing robots. You could use it from the command
line, but it's better to install a user interface such as GoGui:

http://gogui.sourceforge.net/

5) In GoGui, attach the Gongo program. Select:

   Program -> New Program... 

Then enter the full path to the main executable.

To have Gongo play itself on a 9x9 board:

Game -> New Game
Game -> Board Size -> 9
Game -> Computer Color -> Both
