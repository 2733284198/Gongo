Installation instructions for Gongo:

1) Install a Go language compiler. I mostly use gc but have occasionally
tried gccgo.

Instructions: http://golang.org/doc/install.html

2) Run tests

cd gongo
gotest

3) Build the binaries

make

There are two binaries, main and benchmark.

The "benchmark" program plays games against itself out to a given number of
moves. It's useful mostly for performance testing.

The "main" program speaks a minimal version of the Go Text Protocol (GTP),
which is a standard for Go-playing robots. 

4) Install GoGui

You could use "main" from the command line, but it's better to install a user
interface such as GoGui.

5) Configure GoGui to use Gongo

In GoGui, attach the Gongo program. Select:

   Program -> New Program... 

Then enter the full path to the main executable.

6) Play some games

You can play games against Gongo or have it play itself. To have Gongo play
itself on a 9x9 board:

Game -> New Game
Game -> Board Size -> 9
Game -> Computer Color -> Both
