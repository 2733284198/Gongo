Installation instructions for Gongo:

1) Install the Go compiler. (I have tried gccgo but not recently. These
instructions are for the Go compiler.)

Instructions: http://golang.org/doc/install.html

2) Run tests

You can do this from the "gongo" subdirectory:

cd gongo
go test
cd ..

3) Build and run binaries

There are two binaries, main and benchmark.

The "benchmark" program plays games against itself out to a given number of
moves. It's useful mostly for performance testing.

go run benchmark.go

The "main" program speaks a minimal version of the Go Text Protocol (GTP),
which is a standard for Go-playing robots. 

go build main.go

4) Install GoGui

You could use "main" from the command line, but it's better to install a user
interface such as GoGui.

5) Configure GoGui to use Gongo

In GoGui, attach the Gongo program. Select:

   Program -> New Program... 

Then enter the full path to the main executable and the number of playouts
wanted. For example, here's how I run it:

  /Users/skybrian/projects/gongo/main 10000

6) Play some games

You can play games against Gongo or have it play itself. To have Gongo play
itself on a 9x9 board:

Game -> New Game
Game -> Board Size -> 9
Game -> Computer Color -> Both
